# Pokémon Website

The Pokémon Website is a full-stack web application built as my final project for the CS50 Web Development course. As a lifelong Pokémon fan, I wanted to pay tribute to the series by recreating the official Pokémon website, diving deep into how it functions behind the scenes. This project, built using Django, Python, and JavaScript, replicates key features like Pokémon listings, user authentication, a forum for discussions, and interactive elements like search and category filtering. It was a challenging yet rewarding journey that sharpened my skills in both backend and frontend development.

The idea sparked during Week 0 of CS50 when I worked with Scratch, inspiring me to combine my love for Pokémon with my growing passion for web development. The result is a feature-rich, visually faithful that mirrors the look and feel of the original Pokémon website while adding my own touch with interactive functionalities.

## Deployed Link

_Note: This website is not deployed due to CS50 guidelines._  
GitHub Repo: [Pokémon Website](https://github.com/THEBOSS0369/Pokemon-Website)

## Tech Stack

- **Python with Django**: Powers the backend with robust models, views, and URL routing for handling user interactions and data.
- **JavaScript**: Drives frontend interactivity, including search, sliders, and dynamic content updates.
- **HTML/CSS**: Replicates the aesthetic of the official Pokémon website with responsive layouts and polished styling.
- **SQLite**: Manages the database for users, Pokémon listings, comments, and forum posts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, logout, and registration system for users to interact with the site.
- **Pokémon Listings**: Displays Pokémon with details like name, description, number, and category, with pagination for easy browsing.
- **Search & Filter**: Search by Pokémon name or number, with related results and category-based filtering.
- **Surprise Me Button**: Scrolls to a random set of Pokémon for a fun, interactive experience.
- **Create Pokémon**: Allows users to add new Pokémon with details like name, description, image URL, number, and category.
- **Forum**: Interactive section for users to create and view posts, fostering community discussions.
- **Comment System**: Users can comment on Pokémon listings to share thoughts or ask questions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Story Page**: Features an image slider and scroll-to-top button, mimicking the official site’s storytelling section.

## File Structure

The codebase is organized for clarity and scalability:

- **`models.py`**: Defines models for User, Category, Bid (unused), Listing (Pokémon data), Comment, and Post (forum).
- **`views.py`**: Handles user authentication, listing management, commenting, forum posts, and static pages like Story and Animation.
- **`urls.py`**: Maps URLs to corresponding views for seamless navigation.
- **`templates/`**:
  - `layout.html`: Base layout for all pages.
  - `index.html`: Main Pokémon listing page with search, sort, and surprise me features.
  - `listing.html`: Displays individual Pokémon details and comments.
  - `create.html`: Form for adding new Pokémon.
  - `forum.html`: Forum with post creation and comment functionality.
  - `story.html`: Story section with an image slider and scroll-to-top button.
  - `login.html` & `register.html`: User authentication pages.
  - `animation.html`: Entertainment-focused page for added flair.
  - `watchlist.html`: Planned but unused feature for adding Pokémon to teams.

## Challenges and Learnings

This project was a deep dive into full-stack development. Recreating the Pokémon website’s aesthetic required meticulous CSS work to match its vibrant, polished look. Implementing JavaScript functionalities like the search and surprise me button taught me how to handle dynamic content efficiently. On the backend, managing Django models and views for listings and comments was complex but helped me master database relationships. I initially planned features like a Pokémon Mart or team-building watchlist but scaled back to focus on core functionality, learning to prioritize effectively. The CS50 course and instructor Brian Yu were instrumental in guiding me through this process, making this project a true milestone in my coding journey.

## Category

This is was my very first full stack project i built without using AI. So i would categorize it as a Hard Project for that time.

## Purpose

Purpose was to tribute to pokemon as my fav character ASH left pokemon T\_\_T, so for that i created the Pokemon Website as my final project for The CS50 Course.
