# SourceSmart AI Landing Page Redesign

As the Frontend Founding Engineer for SourceSmart AI, I spearheaded the complete redesign of the landing page, transforming a previously lackluster and outdated design into a visually stunning, modern, and highly functional website in just three days. The old version, hosted at [https://sourcesmart.ai/](https://sourcesmart.ai/), suffered from poor aesthetics, limited interactivity, and an uninspiring user experience. The revamped landing page, accessible for preview at [https://source-smart-hq4b.vercel.app/](https://source-smart-hq4b.vercel.app/), leverages cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, Shadcn UI, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux to deliver a seamless and engaging experience for users. Note that the redesigned site is not yet deployed but is scheduled for release in the next app update.

This rapid redesign project was a testament to efficient planning and execution, blending modern design principles with robust technical architecture. The goal was to create a landing page that not only showcases SourceSmart AI’s innovative capabilities but also captivates visitors with a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface. The result is a website that feels professional, approachable, and aligned with the brand’s mission to deliver intelligent sourcing solutions.

## Deployed Links

- **New Website (Preview)**: [SourceSmart AI](https://source-smart-hq4b.vercel.app/) (Not yet deployed, scheduled for next release)
- **Old Website**: [SourceSmart AI (Legacy)](https://sourcesmart.ai/)
- **GitHub Repo**: [SourceSmart AI Redesign](https://github.com/THEBOSS0369/source-smart)

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Provides a powerful React-based framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance.
- **Shadcn UI**: A component library that enabled rapid development of accessible, customizable, and visually appealing UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability, reducing errors in a complex frontend application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Powers the styling with utility-first CSS, enabling a responsive and highly customizable design.
- **Redux**: Manages state for dynamic components, ensuring smooth data flow across the application.

## Features

- **Modern Visual Design**: The new landing page features a clean, minimalistic aesthetic with vibrant colors, smooth animations, and a professional layout that aligns with SourceSmart AI’s brand identity.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully optimized for all devices, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
- **Interactive Components**: Includes dynamic sections like feature cards, testimonials, and a call-to-action (CTA) form, all built with Shadcn UI for accessibility and interactivity.
- **Fast Performance**: Leverages Next.js’s static site generation and optimized asset delivery for lightning-fast load times.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux to handle complex state interactions, such as form submissions and dynamic content updates.

## File Structure

The codebase is organized for scalability and maintainability:

- **`app/`**: Contains Next.js app router files for page routing and layouts.
  - `page.tsx`: Main landing page component.
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with global styles and navigation.
- **`components/`**: Reusable components built with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.
  - `HeroSection.tsx`: Hero banner with headline and CTA.
  - `FeatureCard.tsx`: Dynamic feature showcase cards.
  - `TestimonialSlider.tsx`: Interactive testimonial carousel.
- **`store/`**: Redux store setup and slices for state management.
- **`styles/`**: Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images and fonts.

## Challenges and Learnings

As the Frontend Founding Engineer, I completed this redesign in an intensive three-day sprint, which required meticulous planning and rapid execution. The old website had a dated design with poor responsiveness and lacked modern interactivity, making it unappealing to users. Transitioning to a Next.js-based architecture in such a short timeframe demanded efficient workflows to ensure performance and SEO optimization. Integrating Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS was initially challenging due to customization needs, but it taught me how to balance pre-built components with bespoke styling under tight deadlines. Implementing Redux for state management was another hurdle, especially for handling dynamic form states and user interactions, but it reinforced my understanding of scalable state management. TypeScript’s strict typing helped catch errors early, making the codebase more robust. This project deepened my expertise in modern frontend development, rapid prototyping, and UI/UX design principles.

## Improvements Over the Old Design

The previous version of the SourceSmart AI website ([https://sourcesmart.ai/](https://sourcesmart.ai/)) was visually unappealing, with a cluttered layout, inconsistent typography, and limited responsiveness. Navigation was unintuitive, and the lack of interactive elements failed to engage users. The new design addresses these issues by:

- **Enhanced Aesthetics**: A modern color palette, smooth gradients, and high-quality visuals create an inviting first impression.
- **Improved UX**: Streamlined navigation, clear CTAs, and interactive elements like hover effects and animations guide users effortlessly.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The old site was barely functional on mobile devices, while the new site is fully responsive with a mobile-first approach.
- **Performance Boost**: Next.js’s optimizations reduced load times significantly compared to the old site’s sluggish performance.

## Category

This is an advanced-level project due to the integration of multiple modern technologies, complex state management, and the challenge of completing a full redesign in just three days.

## Purpose

The redesign was undertaken to modernize the SourceSmart AI brand, improve user engagement, and create a scalable foundation for future feature additions. As the Frontend Founding Engineer, I aimed to deliver a high-quality landing page under a tight deadline, while also deepening my expertise in Next.js, TypeScript, and advanced UI/UX design with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. The redesigned site is poised to elevate the brand’s online presence upon its deployment in the next app release.
