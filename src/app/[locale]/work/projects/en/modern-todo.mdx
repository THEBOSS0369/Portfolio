# Modern To-Do App

Modern To-Do App is a sleek, user-friendly web application designed to help you organize your daily tasks with style and efficiency. Built from scratch in just _one hour_ using Lovable and Claude, this project showcases the power of AI-assisted development to create a fully functional, visually stunning app in record time. With a modern dark theme, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations, this app not only keeps your tasks in check but also makes task management feel effortless and enjoyable.

The inspiration for this project came after a grueling exam season when I needed a tool to bring order to my chaotic schedule. Using Lovable’s AI capabilities and Claude’s intuitive assistance, I was able to go from concept to deployment in a single hour, proving that rapid development doesn’t have to compromise quality. This app is perfect for anyone looking to manage tasks with a clean, modern interface and advanced features.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15+ with TypeScript**: Provides a robust, type-safe framework for building performant web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid styling with a utility-first approach, creating a cohesive and customizable design.
- **Framer Motion**: Powers smooth animations like fade-ins, slides, and scale effects for a polished user experience.
- **Vercel**: Simplifies deployment, ensuring the app is live and accessible with minimal setup.
- **Lovable & Claude**: AI tools used to accelerate development, guiding the creation of clean, modern code.

## Features

- **Beautiful Dark Theme**: A visually appealing design with glassmorphism effects and gradient accents.
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion adds fade-in/out, scale, and slide effects for a dynamic feel.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks seamlessly.
- **Advanced Task Management**: Track task status, set priority levels, and assign due dates.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find tasks with intuitive search and filtering options.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Visualize your progress with insightful task tracking metrics.
- **Responsive Design**: Works flawlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Local Storage**: Persists tasks between sessions for uninterrupted productivity.

## File Structure

The codebase is organized for clarity and scalability within the `src/` folder:

- `src/app/`: Next.js app router files for routing and page structure.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components for modularity.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript definitions for type safety and consistency.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building an app in just one hour was a thrilling challenge. Lovable’s limit of five prompts per day forced me to be strategic, carefully planning each step to maximize efficiency. Pairing it with Claude made the process feel almost magical, as the AI guided me through creating clean, modern code. I encountered a few bugs along the way—like ensuring local storage worked seamlessly—but debugging them taught me how to optimize performance under tight constraints. This project deepened my appreciation for AI-driven development and how tools like Lovable can empower developers to build fast without sacrificing quality.

## Category

This is not very serious or hardcore project, just built to try new ai technologies.

## Purpose

Created to see the power of AI ... And guess what i found a hole that haven't been noticed yet. But i am gonna fix it ;)
