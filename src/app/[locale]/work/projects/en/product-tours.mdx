# Product Tours

Product Tours is an innovative SaaS web application designed to help businesses and creators build stunning, interactive product demonstrations in minutes. This project, crafted in just _two hours_ using Lovable and Claude, allows users to record, edit, and share engaging product tours that captivate audiences and showcase features with flair. Whether you're a startup founder, marketer, or developer, Product Tours makes it easy to create polished demos that leave a lasting impression.

Inspired by the need for quick, professional product showcases, I built this app to streamline the process of creating interactive demos. Using AI-driven tools like Lovable and Claude, I went from concept to a fully deployed application in record time, proving that rapid development can deliver powerful results. The app’s intuitive editor and responsive design make it a go-to tool for anyone looking to elevate their product presentations.

## File Structure

The codebase is organized for clarity and maintainability within the `src/` folder:

- `src/app/`: Next.js app router files for routing and page structure.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components for modularity and consistency.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript definitions for type safety and robust development.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building Product Tours in just two hours was an exhilarating challenge. With Lovable’s limit of five prompts per day, I had to plan each step carefully to maximize efficiency. Claude’s AI assistance was a game-changer, helping me structure the editor and preview functionality seamlessly. A few bugs, like syncing live previews with edits, required quick debugging, but overcoming them taught me how to balance speed with precision. This project reinforced the potential of AI-driven tools to transform development workflows, allowing me to create a feature-rich SaaS product in a fraction of the usual time.

## Category

This is mid level project, built to try lovable but becuase i had only 3 prompts so i had to make sure while prompting and debugging the error.

## Purpose

Created to see the power of AI ... And guess what i found a hole that haven't been noticed yet. But i am gonna fix it ;)
