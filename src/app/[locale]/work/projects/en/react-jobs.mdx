# React Jobs

React Jobs is a full-stack web application that marks my first dive into building with React and Vue.js. Created in July 2024, this project is a job listing platform that allows users to manage job postings with ease. By leveraging a JSON file as a lightweight database, the app supports full CRUD functionality—displaying, adding, editing, and deleting job listings. This project was a pivotal learning experience, helping me grasp the fundamentals of both React and Vue.js while building a practical, user-focused application.

As my first major project, React Jobs was born from a desire to understand how to create a functional, interactive web app from scratch. It’s designed for users who need a simple yet effective way to manage job listings, whether for a small business or a personal project. The clean interface and straightforward functionality make it a solid foundation for further enhancements.

GitHub Repo: [React Jobs](https://github.com/THEBOSS0369/React-Jobs)

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Powers both the frontend and backend, providing a dynamic and component-based architecture.
- **Vue.js**: Used alongside React to explore and implement frontend features, enhancing interactivity.
- **JSON File**: Serves as a lightweight database to store and manage job listing data.
- **JavaScript**: Drives the core logic for CRUD operations and user interactions.

## Features

- **Display Jobs**: View a comprehensive list of job postings with details like title, description, and other relevant information.
- **Add Job**: Create new job postings by entering details through an intuitive form.
- **Edit Job**: Update existing job listings to keep information current.
- **Delete Job**: Remove job postings from the database with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability across devices, from desktops to mobiles.

## File Structure

The codebase is structured for clarity and ease of maintenance:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main application code.
  - `components/`: Reusable React and Vue.js components for job listings, forms, and UI elements.
  - `data/`: JSON file serving as the database for job listings.
  - `pages/`: React components for different views like job list and add/edit forms.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building React Jobs as my first project was both exciting and humbling. Learning to integrate React and Vue.js together taught me the importance of component-based architecture and state management. Managing the JSON file as a database was a challenge, especially ensuring data persistence and handling CRUD operations efficiently. I faced hurdles with syncing frontend updates to the backend JSON file, but debugging these issues deepened my understanding of data flow. This project laid a strong foundation for my journey in full-stack development, sparking my passion for creating user-focused applications.

## Category

This is mid level project as it was my very first react and vue.js project and first time working with dataset.

## Purpose

Developed to learn about react fundamentals.
