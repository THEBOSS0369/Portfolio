## Overview

Image Analyzer is a web application that allows users to upload an image's link and receive detailed information about its contents. For example, if a user uploads an image of vegetables, the application will identify and display the names of all vegetables present in the image. The project utilizes the Clarifai API for image recognition, Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn for component styling, and Next UI for an enhanced user interface. Future enhancements, such as Video Analysis for extracting details from videos, are planned for later this year as I embark on an internship that may delay further development.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload images via a link.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Leverages the Clarifai API to provide comprehensive insights into the image's content.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Styled Components**: Utilizes Shadcn and Next UI for aesthetically pleasing and functional component styling.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for implementing functionality.
- **Clarifai API**: For advanced image recognition capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For creating a responsive design with utility-first CSS.
- **Shadcn**: For component styling to enhance visual consistency.
- **Next UI**: For user interface components and design consistency.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges faced during the development was effectively integrating the Clarifai API while ensuring the application remains user-friendly. Managing state and data flow was crucial in providing accurate results quickly. Additionally, refining the user interface to make it intuitive required several iterations and user feedback.

## Outcome

The Image Analyzer is now fully functional, enabling users to analyze images efficiently. The application provides a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as video analysis, which will expand its capabilities. This project has strengthened my skills in web development and API integration, setting the stage for continued learning and growth in the field.
